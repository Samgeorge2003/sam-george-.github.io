## Projects

### [1. GUI Calculator](https://github.com/Aryan-Ghasoliya/Calculator)
A GUI Calculator is a user-friendly application with a graphical interface for performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Built using Python libraries like tkinter or PyQt, it features buttons for digits, operations, and clear/reset functions. It displays input and results in a text box, mimicking a physical calculator. 



### [2. Email Sender](https://github.com/Samgeorge2003/Email-Sender)
This Python script defines a function, send_email, that sends an email using Gmail's SMTP server. The function takes the sender's email and password, recipient's email, email subject, and message as inputs. It uses the smtplib library to connect to Gmail's SMTP server on port 587, establishes a secure connection with starttls, and logs in with the provided credentials. The email content is created using the email.mime module, with the message attached in plain text format. After sending the email, the server connection is closed. An example usage is provided, demonstrating how to call the function with appropriate credentials and email details.

### [3.File Organizer](https://github.com/Samgeorge2003/-File-Organizer)
This Python script defines a function, organize_files, to sort files in a specified directory into categorized subfolders based on their extensions, such as Images, Documents, Audio, Video, Archives, Scripts, and Others. The script first checks if the provided directory exists. It then iterates over all files in the directory, categorizing them based on predefined file type extensions. Files are moved into corresponding subfolders, which are created if they don’t already exist. Files with unrecognized extensions are placed in an "Others" folder. An example usage allows the user to input a directory path, and the script organizes its contents accordingly.

### [4. To Do List Application](https://github.com/Samgeorge2003/To-Do-List-Application)
This script creates a simple To-Do List application using Tkinter. It features an input field for entering tasks, a listbox to display tasks, and buttons to add, delete, or clear tasks. The add_task function adds tasks to the listbox, delete_task removes the selected task, and clear_tasks clears all tasks. It includes error handling for empty input and unselected tasks using message boxes. The graphical interface is set up with Tkinter widgets, and the application runs in a loop to allow user interaction.
